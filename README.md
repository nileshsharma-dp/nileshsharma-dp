Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a biotech enthusiast with 5 years of experience in API manufacturing fermentation and QC of drugs using HPLC. ðŸ§ª I've also dived into clinical studies in the biopharma space. After that, I took a leap into the business world for 3 years, where I learned the ins and outs of entrepreneurship. ðŸ’¼

Now, Iâ€™m making the jump into data science because I love playing with data and uncovering insights that can drive real change. ðŸ“Šâœ¨ Iâ€™m all about blending my science background with fresh analytical skills to tackle new challenges. Always down to learn and grow, Iâ€™m excited for whatâ€™s next in this data-driven journey! ðŸš€
